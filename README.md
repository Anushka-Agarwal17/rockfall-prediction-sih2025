# Rockfall Prediction System – SIH 2025  

## 📌 Problem Statement  
Rockfalls in open-pit mines pose a serious risk to workers and equipment. Traditional systems rely on manual inspections or costly proprietary tools, which are either slow or lack real-time predictive power.  

This project aims to build an **AI-powered Rockfall Prediction System** that integrates **machine learning, IoT data, and visualization dashboards** to predict and prevent rockfall incidents in mining operations.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Predict potential rockfall risks using AI/ML.  
- Process **multi-source data** (DEM, drone imagery, geotechnical sensors, weather).  
- Provide **real-time risk maps** and probability forecasts.  
- Generate **alerts (SMS/Email)** for early action.  
- Offer a **user-friendly web dashboard** for monitoring.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Machine Learning** → Scikit-learn / TensorFlow / PyTorch  
- **Backend API** → FastAPI  
- **Frontend Dashboard** → Streamlit / React  
- **Database** → PostgreSQL / SQLite  
- **Visualization** → Plotly / Matplotlib / Mapbox
